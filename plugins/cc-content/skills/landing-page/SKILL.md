# Landing Page Skill

You are helping the owner produce a complete, publishable landing page. The page
must comply with the format guidelines in this skill folder, reflect the company's
brand voice, and — if a campaign briefing is present — serve the briefing's goals.

This skill is **language-, industry-, and audience-neutral**. It works for any
output language and any B2B or B2C context. Calibration happens through the
loaded context files, the campaign briefing, and the owner's topic input.

`format-guidelines.md` covers the full page-length spectrum — from short single-CTA
inbound registration pages (gated content / webinar sign-up) to longer direct-sales
pages — and gives extra depth to the short-form case. This skill does not assume
which one a given project needs; Step 3 infers the funnel stage (and therefore page
length, form friction, and CTA directness) from loaded context and the campaign
brief, and asks the owner directly whenever that inference isn't confident.

## Step 0: Recall learnings

If `.claude/learnings.md` exists, read it silently. Apply all entries relevant to
this run — both `[cc-content:landing-page]`-tagged entries and entries from other
plugins that inform content quality or project constraints. Do not announce this
step. If the file is absent, continue normally.

## Step 1: Load context

Check for a `## Context files` table in CLAUDE.md via:

```bash
grep -A 200 '## Context files' CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "(no context table)"
```

CLAUDE.md files may exist at multiple hierarchy levels (workspace root, project root,
sub-directory) and the harness loads all applicable ones. Where multiple tables exist,
rows from more specific CLAUDE.md files take precedence.

**Do not enumerate required categories by name.** Context rows carry free-form,
user-chosen labels — there is no schema of category names to match against. Instead,
Read every file listed in the **File** column, then assess each row's **Summary** to
work out what it covers, and map the loaded files to the skill's content needs:

| Need                    | What to look for in the Summary                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brand voice             | Writing style, tone, vocabulary, phrasing rules, things to avoid                                                        |
| Organization background | Who the company/author is, products, positioning, mission                                                               |
| Target audience         | Reader personas, goals, challenges, job titles                                                                          |
| Output language         | Default language, locale, or region                                                                                     |
| Format-specific rules   | Rules governing landing pages specifically (e.g. legal disclaimers, domain/hosting constraints, approved form-provider) |

Where multiple files plausibly cover the same need, pick the one whose Summary best
fits the task at hand and note the choice.

Warn on **semantic absence, not label absence** — "No brand voice context found",
never "no `writing-style` row". Gate on two needs only: if no loaded file plausibly
covers **brand voice**, or none covers **organization background**, ask once whether
this is intentional or whether the user should pause and run `/content-onboarding`.
Same pause / DEGRADED OUTPUT pattern as all output-format skills. For absent audience,
language, or format-specific rules: note silently and continue — never ask.

See `../_shared/context-categories.md` for the full guide to common context patterns
and the authoring rules this step follows.

## Step 2: Check for campaign briefing

Determine the briefing path:

1. If the owner passed a file path as an argument (`$ARGUMENTS`), use that path.
2. Otherwise, check for `brief.md` in the current working directory:

```bash
ls brief.md 2>/dev/null && echo "found" || echo "missing"
```

- **Found** (either via argument or `brief.md`): read the file and note its key
  messages, goals, and constraints. Confirm: "✓ Campaign briefing loaded from
  `<path>`."
- **Missing**: note "No campaign briefing found — generating from company context
  only." and continue.

## Step 3: Infer and confirm audience, goal, and funnel stage

1. Use the loaded audience context and campaign brief (if any) to infer: B2B or
   B2C, content goal (see the goal table in `format-guidelines.md` — most landing
   pages are lead generation or conversion), funnel stage (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU — gated
   content, webinar registration, or direct sale), and audience expertise level. If
   the loaded context genuinely does not support a confident inference, ask the
   owner the missing question directly rather than guessing.
2. Present a one-line inference summary to the user, for example:
   "Audience: B2B (mid-market) · Goal: lead generation · Stage: TOFU (gated content) ·
   Expertise: familiar"
3. Ask the user to confirm or correct before generating. Do not silently apply
   assumptions.
4. Based on confirmed values, explicitly state which Layer 2 (B2B/B2C, persuasion
   principles) and Layer 3 (goal, funnel stage, audience expertise) variations from
   `format-guidelines.md` are being applied and why — including page length target,
   form field count, and CTA directness for the confirmed funnel stage.

## Step 4: Ask for the content topic (if not provided)

Ask: "What should this landing page be about? What's the offer — a gated asset, a
webinar, a demo, or a direct purchase?" and wait.

## Step 5: Select storytelling framework

Read `../_shared/storytelling-frameworks.md` and follow its selection process. Apply
the chosen framework as the structural spine — for short registration pages this
mainly shapes the hero/value section; for longer direct-sales pages it shapes the
full page arc.

## Step 6: Select persuasion principles

Read `../_shared/persuasion-principles.md` and follow its selection process. Pick
1–3 principles plus a pre-suasive opener strategy, informed by the B2B/B2C guidance
in the "Persuasion principles" table of `format-guidelines.md`. Note the choices in
working notes.

## Step 7: Generate the landing page

Produce a complete landing page that applies the confirmed format-guidelines
variant (funnel stage, B2B/B2C, audience expertise), the chosen storytelling
framework, the selected persuasion principles, and any loaded brand-voice and
audience context. Structure the output using the required sections from
`format-guidelines.md` Layer 1 (header zone, hero/above-the-fold, value/proof
section, social proof, closing CTA), and include:

- Headline and subheadline (message-matched to the campaign brief/ad copy if one
  was loaded)
- Primary CTA copy, stated once and repeated identically at each section break
- Form field list, sized to the confirmed funnel stage and goal — state which
  fields were included and why
- Social proof placement and content (specific, attributed, recent — per
  guidelines)
- Any mandatory elements surfaced by the **format-specific rules** context loaded
  in Step 1 — legal disclaimers, jurisdiction-specific consent-checkbox wording,
  brand-mandated footer content, or a specific form/CRM provider's field names.
  If Step 1 found no format-specific rules context and the confirmed audience is
  EU/German (see Privacy, Consent, and Compliance in `format-guidelines.md`), ask
  the owner once for the required consent wording rather than inventing it.

Internally verify against the quality checklist in `format-guidelines.md` before
presenting.

If, after applying the above, a mandatory element is still unresolved — no context
covers it and the owner hasn't stated it — mark it inline with `[TODO: ...]` in the
generated page rather than guessing, and call it out in the closing summary.

Present the output in a clearly delimited block showing the content and its word
count, organized by section (Header / Hero / Value / Social proof / CTA).

If output is degraded (a required context need is uncovered), prepend:
`⚠ DEGRADED OUTPUT — generated without: <list of missing needs>`

## Step 8: Feedback

This step has two phases:

**Auto-store phase.** Before asking the user for feedback, review the run for
qualifying observations. For each, append one tagged line to `.claude/learnings.md`
(create with standard header if missing), tagged `[cc-content:landing-page]`.
Qualifies: content preferences or constraints not already in any loaded context file
or `CLAUDE.md`; corrections the user made; project-specific facts that would change
future output; accepted/rejected suggestions deviating from best practices. Does not
qualify: standard behavior applied without deviation; facts already in context files
or `CLAUDE.md`; anything derivable by re-reading context files; facts semantically
equivalent to any existing `.claude/learnings.md` entry under any plugin tag — when
in doubt, skip; redundancy is worse than a missed entry.

Check for the file before appending:

```bash
ls .claude/learnings.md 2>/dev/null && echo "exists" || echo "missing"
```

Standard header when creating the file:

```markdown
# Learnings

Corrections and feedback collected during content sessions.
Entries are tagged by skill and dated.

---
```

**Explicit feedback.** Ask whether the output met expectations. If the user provides
a correction, append it as a tagged entry using the same criteria. Confirm total
entries written across both phases: "✓ N learning(s) saved to `.claude/learnings.md`."
If the user confirms quality or skips: if any entries were auto-stored, confirm
"✓ N learning(s) auto-saved to `.claude/learnings.md`." Then deliver a closing line
and exit. Tailor the closing delivery note to what was actually produced rather than
a fixed phrase: if the confirmed audience was EU/German, remind the owner to have the
consent-checkbox wording reviewed before publishing; if format-specific rules context
named a page builder, CMS, or form/CRM provider, reference handing the copy off there;
otherwise default to a generic "ready to hand off to your web developer or landing-page
builder."
