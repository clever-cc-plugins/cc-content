# X (Twitter) Post Skill

You are helping the owner produce a complete, publishable X post — whether a single
280-character post or a multi-post thread. The post must comply with the format guidelines
in this skill folder, reflect the company's brand voice, and — if a campaign briefing is
present — serve the briefing's goals.

This skill is **language-, industry-, and audience-neutral**. It works for any output
language and any B2B or B2C context. Calibration happens through the loaded context files
and the owner's topic input.

## Step 0: Recall learnings

If `.claude/learnings.md` exists, read it silently. Apply all entries relevant to this run —
both `[cc-content:*]`-tagged entries and entries from other plugins that inform content
quality or project constraints. Do not announce this step. If the file is absent, continue
normally.

## Step 1: Load context

Read the context table from all loaded CLAUDE.md files:

```bash
grep -A 200 '## Context files' CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "(no context table)"
```

CLAUDE.md files may exist at multiple hierarchy levels (workspace root, project root,
sub-directory). The harness already loads all applicable ones into your context window.
If multiple `## Context files` tables exist, rows from more specific CLAUDE.md files
take precedence over less specific ones.

**If no context table is found** in any loaded CLAUDE.md, ask once:

> "I don't see any context files registered. Would you like to:
> (a) Pause and run `/cc-content-onboarding` to set up context
> (b) Continue without project context (output will be generic)"

Stop if (a); note "generating without project context" and continue if (b).

**If a context table exists**, read every file listed in the **File** column.

After loading, assess what each file covers by reading its **Summary** entry. Map the
loaded files to these content needs:

| Need                    | What to look for in the Summary                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brand voice             | Writing style, tone, vocabulary, phrasing rules, things to avoid     |
| Organization background | Who the company/author is, products, positioning, mission            |
| Target audience         | Reader personas, goals, challenges, job titles                       |
| Output language         | Default language, locale, or region                                  |
| X-specific rules        | Hashtag policies, link policies, thread conventions, CTA constraints |

**When multiple files plausibly cover the same need**, pick the one whose Summary best
fits this specific post. For example: if one file's Summary says "casual, playful — product
announcements" and another says "formal — thought leadership only", and this post is a
product announcement, load the casual one and note the choice.

**Coverage gaps — flag these two:**

If no loaded file plausibly covers **brand voice**, ask once:

> "I don't see any writing style or brand voice context. Is this intentional, or should
> I pause while you run `/cc-content-onboarding`?"
>
> - **Intentional**: note the gap; label the final output `⚠ DEGRADED OUTPUT — no brand voice context`
> - **Pause**: direct the owner to onboarding and stop.

Apply the same ask for **organization background** if no loaded file covers it.

For absent audience, language, or X-specific rules: note silently and continue.

After loading and assessing, note which files were loaded and which need each covers.
Proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2: Check for campaign briefing

Determine the briefing path:

1. If the owner passed a file path as an argument (`$ARGUMENTS`), use that path.
2. Otherwise, check for `brief.md` in the current working directory:

```bash
ls brief.md 2>/dev/null && echo "found" || echo "missing"
```

- **Found** (either via argument or `brief.md`): read the file and note its key messages,
  goals, and constraints. Confirm: "✓ Campaign briefing loaded from `<path>`."
- **Missing**: note "No campaign briefing found — generating from company context only."
  and continue.

## Step 3: Infer and confirm audience and goal

This is the content-production-specific step.

1. Use the loaded audience context and campaign brief (if any) to infer:
   - **Audience type**: B2B or B2C (or multi-audience)
   - **Content goal**: awareness, consideration, conversion, retention, advocacy, or education
     (from the goal variations in format-guidelines.md)
   - **Funnel stage**: TOFU, MOFU, or BOFU (if applicable; may be N/A for some goals)
   - **Audience expertise level**: novice, familiar, or expert

2. If the loaded context genuinely does not support a confident inference, ask the owner
   the missing question directly rather than guessing.

3. Present a one-line inference summary to the user, for example:
   "Audience: B2B (SaaS) · Goal: lead generation · Stage: MOFU · Expertise: familiar"

4. Ask the user to confirm or correct before generating. Do not silently apply assumptions.

5. Based on confirmed values, explicitly state which Layer 2 and Layer 3 variations from
   `format-guidelines.md` are being applied and why. For example:
   "Applying B2B expertise-signaling tone (Layer 2) and consideration-goal thread structure (Layer 3)."

## Step 4: Ask for the post topic and format (if not provided)

If the owner has not specified a topic or goal for the post, ask:

> "What should this X post be about? You can describe the topic, share a key message you
> want to convey, paste a rough note, or link to a page you'd like promoted."

Wait for the answer, then proceed.

Based on the topic and goal, determine whether a thread or single post is appropriate.
Present a recommendation and ask for confirmation:

> "This looks like a [thread / single post] because [reason from format-guidelines.md].
> Should I generate a [5–7 post thread / single 280-character post]? Or would you prefer
> the other format?"

Accept the owner's preference, but note the strategic reason if they choose differently.

## Step 5: Select storytelling framework

Read `../_shared/storytelling-frameworks.md` and follow the selection process described
there. Apply the chosen framework as the structural spine of the post or thread.

## Step 6: Select persuasion principles

Read `../_shared/persuasion-principles.md` and follow its selection process. Pick 1–3
principles that fit the post's goal and the reader's state, plus a pre-suasive opener
strategy. Note the choice in working notes (e.g., "Using **Scarcity + Social Proof**,
opener leads with limited-time value").

## Step 7: Generate the X post

Produce a complete X post (single or thread) that:

- **Single post (280 characters max):**
  - Opens with a strong hook (grabs attention in 1 second per format-guidelines.md)
  - Contains one clear idea or call-to-action
  - Uses 0–2 hashtags only (never 3+)
  - Invites conversation or action via a specific, singular CTA
  - Includes 1–2 emojis at natural pauses (if brand voice permits)
  - Omits links unless account is Premium (links reduce reach 50–90%)
  - Applies selected storytelling framework and persuasion principles

- **Thread (5–7 posts):**
  - Post 1 (hook post): numbered "1/[N]" with value promise
  - Posts 2–[N-1] (body): one self-contained idea per post, clear logical flow
  - Post [N] (final): explicit CTA (follow, retweet, answer question, etc.)
  - Each post ≤280 characters
  - Total structure applies selected framework and persuasion principles

Internal verification checklist from `format-guidelines.md`:

- Hook grabs attention in first line (strong opening within ~1 second)
- Character count appropriate (280 for single posts; 5–7 posts for threads)
- One idea per post
- CTA is singular and easy to answer
- Hashtags: 0–2 only
- No links (or Premium-only links)
- Tone matches audience (B2B vs. B2C calibration)
- If thread: 5–7 posts, hook/body/CTA structure
- Conversation-inviting element present
- Emojis: 1–2 max

Reflect tone and vocabulary from loaded brand voice context and audience context. If the
briefing is present, the post must serve its stated goals and key messages.

Present the post in a clear block:

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────
X post draft
─────────────────────────────────────────────
<post or thread content>
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Character count: <N> / 280 (single post)
  OR
Thread: <N> posts total
```

If output is degraded (brand voice or organization context missing), prepend:

```
⚠ DEGRADED OUTPUT — generated without: <list of missing context>
```

## Step 8: Feedback

**Auto-store phase.** Before asking for feedback, review this run. For each qualifying
observation, append one tagged line to `.claude/learnings.md` (create with standard
header if missing):

```text
[cc-content:cc-content-x-post] <concise observation> — <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

Qualifies: content preferences or constraints not already in any loaded `context/` file
or `CLAUDE.md`; corrections the owner made to the output; project-specific facts that
would change future output; accepted/rejected suggestions deviating from best practices.

Does not qualify: standard behavior applied without deviation; facts already in context
files or `CLAUDE.md`; anything derivable by re-reading context files; facts semantically
equivalent to an existing `.claude/learnings.md` entry under any plugin tag — when in
doubt, skip; redundancy is worse than a missed entry.

Check for the file before appending:

```bash
ls .claude/learnings.md 2>/dev/null && echo "exists" || echo "missing"
```

Standard header when creating the file:

```markdown
# Learnings

Corrections and feedback collected during content sessions.
Entries are tagged by skill and dated.

---
```

**Explicit feedback.** After the auto-store phase, ask:

> "Did this post meet expectations? If you have any corrections or notes for future posts,
> share them here — or press Enter to finish."

- If the owner **provides a correction**: append it as a tagged entry using the same format
  and qualification criteria above. Confirm total entries written across both phases:
  "✓ N learning(s) saved to `.claude/learnings.md`."
- If the owner **confirms quality or skips**: if any entries were auto-stored, confirm
  "✓ N learning(s) auto-saved to `.claude/learnings.md`." Then say "Great — the post is
  ready to publish. Copy it above and paste directly into X." and exit. If nothing was
  stored, skip the confirmation and exit directly.
