# Promote to Context

You are registering an existing file as context in `CLAUDE.md` so content skills can
discover and load it for future work.

## Step 1: Identify the file and target

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a file path, use it. Otherwise ask:

> "Which file would you like to register as context? (Provide the file path.)"

If `$ARGUMENTS` also names a target `CLAUDE.md` explicitly (e.g. "register x in
`myproject/press/2026/CLAUDE.md`"), record that path. An explicit target is a deliberate
choice — Step 4 uses it directly, no placement questions asked.

Read the file.

## Step 2: Suggest a label

Generate a short, descriptive label (2–5 words) based on the file content. Good labels
are specific enough to distinguish this file from similar ones in the same project:

- Too generic: "Writing style"
- Good: "Brand voice – recruiting"
- Good: "Whitepaper – AI in HR (Q3 2025)"
- Good: "Audience – enterprise buyers"

Present the suggestion and ask the owner to confirm or change it:

> "Suggested label: **[label]**
> (or enter your own — no restrictions)"

## Step 3: Generate a summary

Write a one-sentence summary (10–25 words) from the file content. The summary is the key
signal skills use to decide which file to load for a given task — be specific:

- Too vague: "Writing style guidelines"
- Good: "Formal German, em-dash preferred, no exclamation marks — all corporate copy"
- Good: "Whitepaper on AI in HR published Q3 2025 — use as reference for follow-up content"
- Good: "Three enterprise buyer personas: CHROs, IT directors, and works councils"

Present the suggestion and ask the owner to confirm or change it:

> "Suggested summary: [summary]
> (or enter your own)"

## Step 4: Determine the target CLAUDE.md

If an explicit target was named in `$ARGUMENTS` (Step 1), use it directly and skip to Step 5 —
no placement question, that's the point of naming it explicitly.

Otherwise, scan for candidates:

```bash
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' | sort
```

Find the nearest ancestor `CLAUDE.md` to the file (the root file counts as the outermost
ancestor).

**Use it without asking** only when there's no real choice to make: it's the only `CLAUDE.md`
found anywhere in the project, and it's in the file's own directory or one level above it.

**Otherwise ask** — either the nearest ancestor is more than one directory level above the file,
or other `CLAUDE.md` files exist at different levels, so a vague command genuinely leaves the
level open:

> "`[file]` could be registered at more than one level:
>
> - `[nearest ancestor path]` (closest existing file)
> - `[other candidate path]` (repeat for each other CLAUDE.md found)
> - or a new `[file's directory]/CLAUDE.md`, scoped just to that folder
>
> Which should I use?"

- Owner picks an existing path: use it as the target.
- Owner picks "new": treat this as "target CLAUDE.md does not exist" in Step 5.

## Step 5: Add the row

Make the `File` path relative to the target CLAUDE.md's own directory (not the project root —
see the repo's context-architecture convention).

Show the proposed row before writing:

> "I'll add this row to `[target CLAUDE.md path]`:
>
> | [label] | [file path] | [summary] |
>
> Proceed? (yes / edit / skip)"

- **Yes**, target CLAUDE.md exists: add the row to its `## Context files` table.
  If the section does not exist yet, create it first:

  ```markdown
  ## Context files

  Skills read all registered files and load what's relevant for each task.

  | Label | File | Summary |
  | ----- | ---- | ------- |
  ```

  Then append the row. Confirm: "✓ Registered `[file path]` as context in `[target CLAUDE.md path]`."

- **Yes**, target CLAUDE.md does not exist (no ancestor found, or the owner chose to create a
  new nested one in Step 4): ask "There is no CLAUDE.md at `[target folder]` yet. What should
  its heading say — a project, client, or campaign name?", then create it:

  ```markdown
  # [Name]

  ## Context files

  Skills read all registered files and load what's relevant for each task.

  | Label   | File        | Summary   |
  | ------- | ----------- | --------- |
  | [label] | [file path] | [summary] |
  ```

  Confirm: "✓ `[target CLAUDE.md path]` created and `[file path]` registered."

- **Edit**: ask what to change, update label/summary/path, show again.

- **Skip**: say "Registration cancelled — nothing was written." and exit.
