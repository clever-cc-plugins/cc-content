# cc-content

A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin that provides a suite of content creation skills for marketing projects — brand onboarding, LinkedIn posts, blog articles, sample curation, and session management.

---

## Plugin: `cc-content`

The content-production skills work for any industry, audience, and output language. They automatically use the context files set up during onboarding, and prompt you for any required information that the context does not already cover.

| Skill                                     | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/cc-content:cc-content-onboarding`       | Interviews you about your brand, voice, and audience, then populates `context/` with structured context files that all other skills can read                                                      |
| `/cc-content:cc-content-linkedin-post`    | Drafts LinkedIn posts that match your brand voice, format guidelines, and audience — with a built-in feedback step                                                                                |
| `/cc-content:cc-content-blog-article`     | Drafts blog articles calibrated to your audience type (B2B / B2C), content goal, funnel stage, and reader expertise                                                                               |
| `/cc-content:cc-content-ideation`         | Generates several distinct strategic angles (thesis / goal / perspective) from an article, briefing, or topic — the idea step before writing                                                      |
| `/cc-content:cc-content-text`             | Drafts a finished text for any format without a dedicated skill (press release, newsletter, whitepaper, landing page, email …), routing you to a dedicated skill when one fits better             |
| `/cc-content:cc-content-samples-curation` | Saves gold-standard content examples with annotations to `context/samples.md` so skills can use them as reference material                                                                        |
| `/cc-content:cc-content-session-wrap`     | Reviews session deliverables, logs feedback and corrections, detects recurring patterns, and commits your work                                                                                    |
| `/cc-content:cc-content-new-skill`        | Turns research notes into a complete content-production skill for a new output format. Use it to build project-local custom skills, or add `--plugin` to create a pre-built skill for the plugin. |

## Installation

Open Claude Code in any project and run:

```
/plugin marketplace add clever-cc-plugins/marketplace
/plugin install cc-content@cc-content
```

This makes all skills immediately available.

### Keeping Skills Current

Auto-update is disabled by default for third-party marketplaces. To enable it:

1. Run `/plugin` in Claude Code
2. Go to the **Marketplaces** tab
3. Toggle auto-update for `clever-cc-plugins/marketplace`

Once enabled, skills update automatically on startup when new versions are available.

## Getting Started

**Step 1 — Run onboarding**

Open your marketing project in Claude Code and run the onboarding skill:

```
/cc-content:cc-content-onboarding
```

This populates `context/` with your brand voice, company profile, and buyer personas. The other skills read this context automatically.

**Step 2 — Create content**

Run any output skill:

```
/cc-content:cc-content-linkedin-post
```

For a format without its own skill (press release, newsletter, whitepaper …), use the general writer — or start from ideas first:

```
/cc-content:cc-content-ideation
/cc-content:cc-content-text
```

**Step 3 — Curate good examples**

When a piece of content lands well, save it as a reference sample:

```
/cc-content:cc-content-samples-curation
```

**Step 4 — Wrap your session**

At the end of each working session, commit your work and log any corrections:

```
/cc-content:cc-content-session-wrap
```

## Extending with Custom Content Skills

The plugin ships with LinkedIn post and blog article support today, and more pre-built formats are planned. If you need a content format that isn't covered yet, you can build a project-local skill using `cc-content-new-skill` — no plugin contribution required.

**Workflow:**

1. Run `/cc-content:cc-content-new-skill <format-name>` without any research files. The skill will guide you to a research brief template that tells you what to gather about your target format.
2. Fill in the brief, then re-run `/cc-content:cc-content-new-skill <format-name>` with your research files attached. The skill interviews you about coverage gaps, synthesizes a `format-guidelines.md`, and generates a `SKILL.md` skeleton.
3. Open the generated `SKILL.md` and fill in the `[TODO: ...]` placeholders to tailor the skill to your exact needs.
4. The finished skill lives in `.claude/skills/<format-name>/` and is ready to invoke from there.

If the new format turns out to be broadly useful and you'd like to contribute it back, re-run the skill with `--plugin` to produce a version structured for the plugin repository.

## Context Architecture

Skills follow a three-level context model:

| Level              | Location                                  | What goes here                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Company scope**  | `context/`                                | Brand voice, buyer personas, company profile — applies to all work for this company |
| **Format scope**   | Inside the plugin                         | Structure rules, length limits, tone calibrations for one output type               |
| **Campaign scope** | Project subfolders (e.g. `campaigns/q3/`) | Campaign briefings, key messages, one-off constraints                               |

Load company-scope context by importing it from your project-level `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
@context/brand-voice.md **Read when:** producing any written content
@context/company-profile.md **Read when:** working on any deliverable
@context/buyer-personas.md **Read when:** targeting content at a specific audience segment
```
